This directory contains the R code used to generate the results
presented in the article: "Small Sample Maximum Likelihood Inference
in Latent Variable Models". It is organized as follows:
- the "BATCH_" files define the simulation studies. The output of the
  simulation studies are not save in the directory to save space.
- the "BUILD_simulation.R" file collects the results from the
  simulation studies and save them into data.table objects in the
  folder Results.
- the "RESULTS_" files are used to generate the numbers, figures, and
  tables displayed in the article.
